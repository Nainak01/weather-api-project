# Deployment Plan for Django Application on AWS


## Deploying Django Application with AWS Elastic Beanstalk

### Step 1: Prepare Django Application

1. **Set Up Your Django Application**:
    - Ensure your Django application is configured for production.
    - Update `settings.py` to use environment variables for sensitive information like `SECRET_KEY` and database credentials.

2. **Create a Requirements File**:
    - Generate `requirements.txt` if not already present:
      ```bash
      pip freeze > requirements.txt
      ```

3. **Configure WSGI**:
    - Ensure your Django project has a `wsgi.py` file for WSGI configuration.

### Step 2: Initialize Elastic Beanstalk

1. **Install AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI**:
    - Install using pip:
      ```bash
      pip install awsebcli
      ```

2. **Initialize Elastic Beanstalk Environment**:
    - Navigate to your project directory and run:
      ```bash
      eb init -p python-3.8 my-django-app
      ```
    - Follow the prompts to configure your application.

3. **Create and Deploy Environment**:
    - Create a new environment and deploy:
      ```bash
      eb create my-django-env
      eb deploy
      ```

### Step 3: Configure Load Balancer

1. **Access Elastic Beanstalk Console**:
    - Navigate to the Elastic Beanstalk console and select your environment.

2. **Configure Load Balancer**:
    - Under the Configuration section, select Load Balancer.
    - Choose an appropriate load balancer type (application or classic) based on your needs.

## Database Deployment with Amazon RDS

### Step 1: Create RDS Instance

1. **Launch RDS Instance**:
    - Go to the RDS console and click on “Create database”.
    - Choose PostgreSQL as the database engine.
    - Use the "Standard Create" method.

2. **Configure Database**:
    - Set DB instance identifier, master username, and password.
    - Choose instance class and storage as per your requirements.
    - Ensure Public Accessibility is set according to your security needs.

3. **Network & Security**:
    - Choose the appropriate VPC and subnet.
    - Configure security groups to allow inbound connections from Elastic Beanstalk instances.

### Step 2: Connect Django to RDS

1. **Update `settings.py`**:
    - Configure the database settings:
      ```python
      DATABASES = {
          'default': {
              'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
              'NAME': 'your-db-name',
              'USER': 'your-db-user',
              'PASSWORD': 'your-db-password',
              'HOST': 'your-db-instance-endpoint',
              'PORT': '5432',
          }
      }
      ```

2. **Run Migrations**:
    - Apply migrations to the RDS instance:
      ```bash
      python manage.py migrate
      ```

## Data Storage Solution with AWS S3

1. **Using Amazon S3**:
    - Use S3 for object storage, suitable for storing and retrieving text files.


2. **Configuring Amazon S3**:
    - Create an S3 bucket.
    - Use Boto3 in your Django application to interact with S3:
      ```python
      import boto3
      s3 = boto3.client('s3')
      ```

## Scheduling Data Ingestion with AWS ECS Fargate

### Step 1: Create Docker Image for Data Ingestion

1. **Create Dockerfile**:
    - Write a Dockerfile to containerize your data ingestion script.
      ```Dockerfile
      FROM python:3.8
      COPY . /app
      WORKDIR /app
      RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
      CMD ["python", "ingest_data.py"]
      ```

2. **Build and Push Docker Image to ECR**:
    - Authenticate Docker to your ECR registry:
      ```bash
      $(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region us-east-1)
      ```
    - Create ECR repository and push the image:
      ```bash
      aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-data-ingestion
      docker build -t my-data-ingestion .
      docker tag my-data-ingestion:latest <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-data-ingestion:latest
      docker push <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-data-ingestion:latest
      ```

### Step 2: Configure ECS Fargate

1. **Create ECS Cluster**:
    - Go to the ECS console and create a new cluster.

2. **Create Task Definition**:
    - Define a new task with Fargate launch type.
    - Specify the Docker image from ECR.
    - Configure task memory and CPU requirements.

3. **Create Scheduled Task**:
    - Use CloudWatch Events to create a rule for scheduling the task.
    - Configure the rule to trigger your ECS task at the desired intervals.

### Step 3: Store Data in RDS

1. **Modify Ingestion Script**:
    - Ensure your ingestion script writes the ingested data to the RDS database using appropriate credentials and connection settings.

## Conclusion

### Scalability and Security

- **Scalability**:
  - Elastic Beanstalk automatically scales your application instances.
  - RDS provides managed scalability for your database.
  - ECS Fargate handles scaling for your data ingestion tasks.

- **Security**:
  - Use IAM roles to securely access AWS services.
  - Configure security groups and VPC settings to control network access.
  - Use AWS Secrets Manager for managing sensitive information like database credentials.

### Summary

This deployment plan ensures a scalable, secure, and manageable serverless deployment of your Django API, database, and data ingestion routine. By leveraging AWS services like Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, S3, ECS Fargate, ECR, and CloudWatch Events, you can effectively handle varying traffic loads and run data ingestion as required, minimizing manual infrastructure management.
