# Weather API with Django: System Overview
This system is designed to provide weather-related information through a Django API. The project comprises four main endpoints: `/api/weather/` for weather records, `/api/weather/stats/` for weather statistics, and `/docs` along with `/redoc` for API documentation using Swagger and ReDoc, respectively.
To get started, set up a virtual environment. Create environment variables. Database configuration is handled through environment variables, ensuring a secure and flexible approach. PostgreSQL is the chosen database, and the system supports both a default database and a separate one for testing.
After creating the required databases and applying migrations, the system ingests using an `dump_data` created in Django management. `dump_data` reads all the files in the `data/wx_data` directory and inserts all the rows from each file sequentially. Running the project initiates the Django development server. Access the API endpoints at `/api/weather/` and `/api/weather/stats/`, and explore documentation through `/docs` and `/redoc`.
Testing is a crucial aspect, and the system includes a total of 8 test cases that include all the possible calls to both endpoints. A testing database is created, migrations are applied specifically for testing, and the test suite is executed to ensure the reliability of the API.

# Deployment approach: AWS
# AWS Deployment Approach for Weather API with Django
To deploy the Weather API with Django on AWS, start by setting up an Amazon RDS instance for PostgreSQL, configuring database parameters, and allowing connections through a security group. Utilize Amazon S3 for data storage by uploading files to an S3 bucket, granting access permissions to a data ingestion Lambda function. Deploy the Django application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, configuring environment variables for database and S3 access. Implement automated Django migration during deployment, leverage Elastic Beanstalk's load balancing and auto-scaling features, and set up monitoring with AWS CloudWatch. Manage API endpoints securely using AWS API Gateway, map a custom domain with Amazon Route 53, and implement security best practices.
